### Summary Data Frame

After reviewing the graph, we can see that Urban area fares spike on weekends as spring time kicked off. All three areas spiked in late february which is likely associated with both Valentine's day and President's day as more companies are observing it as a holiday. Rural areas seem to be consistent in spikes, likely revolving around weekends. 

### Total Fare by City Type

## Summary

### Recommendations
1. Increasing drivers or advertising campaigns on weekdays for all areas could keep increase rides/users. 
2. Increasing drivers on weekends could increase rides in all areas without additional advertising/marketing.
3. Adding in average ride distances for each city type would allow for more actionable insights.

### Disparities Between City Types
1. Suburban city type doesn't follow the same weekend spikes as rural and urban areas. Increasing drivers on weekends in Suburban areas could increase profits.
2. Rural areas have lower populations and so increasing drivers on weekends may be the only time to increase drivers and rides.
3. Urban areas have a higher amount of rides regularly, increasing drivers on weekdays could increase total fares for the entire company.
